	<h1> Summary </h1>
	<p>We utilized the GoFitts software by Scott MacKenzie to measure throughput of two types of pointing conditions. There were a total of 9 sequences and 5 trails for each sequence. Each sequence varied target size and distances between targets. Each condition was tested with 45 pointing tasks. The first condition measured throughput when using a touchscreen to complete each task. The second condition required participants to utilize a trackpad for pointing. There were a total of 4 participants in the study. The study was conducted using within-subjects testing. Therefore, each participant tested each condition. Results are reported below.   </p>
